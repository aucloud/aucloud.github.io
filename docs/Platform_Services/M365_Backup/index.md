## Veeam Backup for M365 Overview

This guide outlines the steps required to implement your Office 365 Backup with AUCyber. You will be allocated a Customer Success Manager (CSM) who will assist you with the on-boarding process, provide advice and act as a conduit to deeper technical support when required.

There are several steps which need to be carried out to configure your M365 Backup account in AUCyber. These steps are outlined below and covered in more detail in separate articles.  

## Provide AUCyber with your backup requirements

Your Sales Executive or CSM will gather your requirements including:

- Microsoft Office Components to be backed up
- Tenancy Size
- Backup information including your Public IP address for gateway allow-listing
- Backup exclusions
- Backup schedule
- Backup repository retention policy, and
- The authentication method  

## Creation of your account in the AUCyber Portal

Your CSM will arrange for an account to be created for you in the AUCyber Portal.

Once your account has been created, your security contact will be required to sign the Community Rules Information Security Policy (CRISP) electronically in the Portal. The CRISP dictates the behaviours and responsibilities for both AUCyber and all customers that we must jointly adhere to.  
  
## Configuration of Microsoft M365 Service account

You will need to configure a Microsoft Veeam Backup Service account. To prevent Microsoft throttling of the backups, we recommend creating 8 users under this account.  

## Provide details to AUCyber

The backup service account username and app password need to be provided to AUCyber to complete the setup of your account. These details can be entered via Webex, Zoom, Teams chat or by coming to our office and entering them manually.  

## Restore records through the Self-Service portal

Records can be restored through the [Self-Service Portal.](../reference_urls.md#veeam-m365-backup-portal)
