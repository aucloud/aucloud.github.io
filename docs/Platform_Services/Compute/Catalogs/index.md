A catalog in VMware Cloud Director is a container for vApp/VM templates and media files which can be shared with organisation within the same VCD instance. A catalog can also be published externally for any user or organisation to access outside VCD environment.

As a tenant there are a couple of ways to upload a VM template to a catalog:

1. Upload an OVF/OVA package directly to a catalog 
2. Save a vApp as a vApp template

For more details on uploading a VM template to a catalog can be found below:
