## Overview

Object storage is a data storage architecture that manages data as objects, as opposed to other storage architectures which manage data as a file hierarchy.  The S3 object storage in use at AUCloud has features to protect data. These features include encryption, access controls, versioning, life cycle policies and object lock.

You can access and manage your bucket from several web browsers with your user credentials. Working with buckets allows you to:

- create or delete buckets
- view and download objects
- add, copy or remove objects
- grant basic read/write permissions
- configure security credentials to access buckets programmatically via S3 APIs
