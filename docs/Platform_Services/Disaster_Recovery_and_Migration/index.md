## Overview

Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS) helps organisations recover from natural disasters, cyber attacks, or other catastrophic events. It involves storing copies of an organization's data, applications, and other critical resources in a secure offsite location, so that they can be accessed and used to resume normal operations if the primary location becomes unavailable.

AUCloud uses VMware Cloud Director Availability. VMware Cloud Director Availability is a comprehensive solution that enables the movement of workloads between on-premises and cloud environments, as well as between different cloud environments. It can be used for on-boarding, migrating, and disaster recovery for multi-tenant cloud sites.
