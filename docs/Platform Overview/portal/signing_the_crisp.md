### Signing the CRISP

The Community Rules Information Security Policy (CRISP) has been developed to ensure all users of the AUCloud platform are aligned in the secure way they connect with and use the platform. The CRISP is held at account level and is only required to be signed by the designated Security Contact.

The CRISP is initially signed by the Assurance User (Security Contact) when you set up your account. The CRISP is regularly updated to remain current with Australian Government policies and procedures as outlined in the Australian Privacy Principles, the Information Security Manual and technical publications produced by ASD, ACSC, NIST and ISO.

You will be alerted to any changes made to the CRISP and will need to acknowledge these changes as they occur. This guide outlines the procedures to follow to sign the CRISP.
