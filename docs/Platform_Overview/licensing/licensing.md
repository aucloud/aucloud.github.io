## Overview

AUCyber can provide licensing for a number of Microsoft; VMware; and Red Hat products when deployed within the AUCyber infrastructure.
Licensing models may change depending on whether AUCyber's multi-tenant platform is used; or if a customer deploys to a dedicated environment.

## Operating system licence templates

AUCyber provided templates for Microsoft Windows (various versions); and Red Hat Enterprise Linux by default will use AUCyber provided Licences.
If you are seeking to Bring Your Own Licence (BYOL), please contact your Customer Success Manager.

## Microsoft Products currently supported by AUCyber

Microsoft's SPLA enables us to sell many products such as Sharepoint Server, Biztalk Server, etc. For a product not on this list please contact [AUCyber Support](../support/index.md) or your sales team.

## Microsoft licensing in AUCyber's multi-tenant platform

AUCyber licences Microsoft products using the Service Provider License Agreement (SPLA).
Unfortunately, this does not provide any not for profit or charity options for licensing.
However, customers can choose to bring their own licences (subject to applicability), through Microsoft's recent improvements in licensing and the Flexible Virtualisation Benefit.

!!! note "Flexible Virtualisation benefit"

    Products covered by the [Flexible Virtualisation Benefit](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Licensing-Guides)
    The Flexible Virtualisation benefit applies to all software products that are available under subscription licenses or licenses with Software Assurance coverage.
    This includes server products such as...SQL Server, Exchange Server, SharePoint Server, System Center and others.
    This also includes desktop products such as Windows 10/11, Office desktop applications and Microsoft 365 Apps.

Customers are also able acquire and bring their own licences (for example Academic or Not For Profit) through other Microsoft licensing schemes such as the Enterprise Agreement or Open Value subscription.
Microsoft provide specific licensing options for some [industries](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/licensing-programs/licensing-for-industries?activetab=licensing-for-industries-pivot:primaryr4) which can be exploited.

### BYOL Windows Server licences

Please note that AUCyber cannot support Customers who wish to bring their own Windows Server licences to our multi-tenant platform as we already provide Windows Server licensing for these servers via Microsoft SPLA. AUCyber cannot 'mix and match' SPLA and FVB Windows Server licensing on these servers.

When servers are dedicated to the Customer's use, they may bring their own licensing. Please contact [AUCyber Support](../support/index.md) or your sales team to discuss this in more detail.


### SQL Developer 

Despite being a 'free' licence, SQL Developer edition is not eligible for license mobility.

Therefore it can only be installed on a dedicated server, or a virtual machine that is hosted on your own dedicated server.



### BYOL Red Hat licences

AUCyber is a registered CCSP which enables us to provide Red Hat licences to Customers. However, we are not a 'Cloud Access' partner, so cannot support customers who wish to bring their own licences at this time.

Please contact [AUCyber Support](../support/index.md) or your sales team if you require this service and we can consider your request.

## AUCyber Hardware dedicated customers

Customers can bring most Microsoft licences to dedicated hardware as, from Microsoftâ€™s perspective, the hardware is no different to the customer running it themselves.
