## Microsoft licensing in AUCloud's multi-tenant platform

AUCloud licences Microsoft products using the Service Provider License Agreement (SPLA).
Unfortunately, this does not provide any not for profit or charity options for licensing.
However, customers can choose to bring their own licences (subject to applicability), through Microsoft's recent improvements in licensing and the Flexible Virtualisation Benefit.

!!! note "Flexible Virtualisation benefit"
    Products covered by the [Flexible Virtualisation Benefit](https://wwlpdocumentsearch.blob.core.windows.net/prodv2/Licensing_guide_PLT_Flexible_Virtualization_Benefit_Nov2022.pdf?sv=2020-08-04&se=2123-01-09T02:48:55Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=KRfr9gBN%2BY%2BQzJUA1U92X2WFAzu4aouo%2FZXL4sxKLM0%3D)
    The Flexible Virtualisation benefit applies to all software products that are available under subscription licenses or licenses with Software Assurance coverage.
    This includes server products such as Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server, SharePoint Server, System Center and others.
    This also includes desktop products such as Windows 10/11, Office desktop applications and Microsoft 365 Apps.

Customers are also able acquire and bring their own licences (for example Academic or Not For Profit) through other Microsoft licensing schemes such as the Enterprise Agreement or Open Value subscription.
Microsoft provide specific licensing options for some [industries](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/licensing-programs/licensing-for-industries?activetab=licensing-for-industries-pivot:primaryr4) which can be exploited.

### BYOL Windows Server licenses

In order to bring Windows servers to the AUCloud shared infrastructure.

!!! note "Minimum core licenses for BYOL"
    There is a Microsoft mandated minimum of 8 cores per windows VM for BYOL.
    Customers are advised that under 8 cores it is likely to be more cost effective provisioning licenses via AUCloud

1. Validate your licenses (see the references below)
1. Provide AUCloud (via support) either
   1. the host-names or;
   1. a VDC where every Microsoft Windows license is BYOL

## AUCloud Hardware dedicated customers

Customers can bring most Microsoft licences to dedicated hardware as, from Microsoftâ€™s perspective, the hardware is no different to the customer running it themselves.
