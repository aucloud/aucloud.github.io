## Overview

The AUCloud CRISP describes the shared security model between AUCloud and the customer.
The shared responsibility model varies based on the underlying service(s) consumed by customers.

## Infrastructure as a Service (Compute)

The IaaS offering is the core of our platform, and hosts any PaaS or SaaS services provided by AUCloud; inheriting the IaaS RACI.

The following diagram describes the shared responsibility for the AUCloud customers and AUCloud for our core IaaS services.
