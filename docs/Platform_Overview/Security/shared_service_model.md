## Overview

The AUCyber CRISP describes the shared security model between AUCyber and the customer.
The shared responsibility model varies based on the underlying service(s) consumed by customers.

## Infrastructure as a Service (Compute)

The IaaS offering is the core of our platform, and hosts any PaaS or SaaS services provided by AUCyber; inheriting the IaaS RACI.

The following diagram describes the shared responsibility for the AUCyber customers and AUCyber for our core IaaS services.
