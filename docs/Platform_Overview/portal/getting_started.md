    For example, if your word is "academic" in the above scenario, characters 2,4 and 8 would be 'c', 'd' and 'c' respectively.

1. The QR code will appear which needs to be scanned into a One-Time Password (OTP) Authenticator app such as Google Authenticator. The authenticator will add an account which will generate a six-digit code which will be required for subsequent logins.
