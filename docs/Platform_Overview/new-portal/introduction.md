# BTS and new AUCloud Portal

## Overview

As we continue to enhance our user experience, we announced a transitional phase where our existing **BTS Portal** will operate side-by-side with the new **AUCloud Portal**. This is a strategic step towards integrating our services more seamlessly while ensuring uninterrupted service.

### BTS Portal
- **Primary Role**: The BTS Portal, our longstanding platform, will continue to manage **VCloud VCD login** and **user management**.

### New AuCloud Portal
- **Introduction**: New AUCloud Portal is our innovative new portal designed to streamline user experience.
- **Features**:
  - **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Introduces SSO functionality, allowing users to directly log into VCloud VCD.
  - **Service Management**: Users can manage their services, accounts, and products efficiently within new AUCloud Portal.
  - **Enhanced User Interface**: With an intuitive design, new AUCloud Portal makes navigation and management easier.

All functionalities, apart from VCD login and user management (handled by BTS), will be operational in the new AUCloud Portal.
