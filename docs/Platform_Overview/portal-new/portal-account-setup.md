## Overview

If you previously had an account on the legacy Portal, you'll be able to log in using the same email address. This guide details the process of the initial login and MFA setup.

### Initial Setup

!!! Note "AUClouds strong security controls mean that passwords and 2FA credentials are encrypted in our database, preventing us from copying existing passwords and 2FA devices to our new Portal. This means that it is necessary for you to set a password and set up 2FA for your new portal account before you're able to log in for the first time."

Every customer of AUCloud is provided with a unique web address (URL) for logging in, which is specific to their account. Our Customer Success team would have shared this web address with you. If you're having trouble finding it, don't hesitate to [get in touch with the AUCloud support team](../../support) for assistance.

When you have your unique web address for logging in, you can begin setting up your new portal account by following these simple steps:

1. Open the web browser on your device.
1. Enter the unique web address (URL) you received from AUCloud into the browser's address bar.
1. This will take you to the login page for your account.
1. Click **I forgot my password**.
