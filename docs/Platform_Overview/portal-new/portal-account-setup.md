## Overview

If you previously had an account on the legacy Portal, you'll be able to log in using the same email address. This guide details the process of the initial login and security setup for these customers.

Please note that at this time, brand new customers without accounts on the legacy Portal will need to be onboarded via the AUCloud Support Desk (support@australiacloud.com.au) before following the steps in this guide.

### Initial Setup

AUClouds strong security controls mean that passwords and 2FA credentials are encrypted in our database, preventing us from copying existing passwords and 2FA devices to our new Portal.

This means that it is necessary for you to set a password and set up 2FA for your new portal account before you're able to log in for the first time.  This is how you do that: 

1. Access the new AUCloud Portal at https://app.aucloud.com.au.
1. Enter your **email** address.
1. Click **Login** to verify your email address.
