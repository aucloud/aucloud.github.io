## Overview
AUCloud is releasing a new portal to address customer feedback on our legacy portal product. Modernising our identity provider solution will allow customers to reset their own password, dramatically extend password reset intervals, remove the inactive account impediment, and allow more streamlined access to the products that our customers use our Portal for. As part of our first release, we will run both portals side-by-side - that is, we will keep the existing portal active to minimise disruption to customers.

To allow for the new solution to function, some changes to the existing customer experience have had to be made which are outlined below. 

### Virtual Cloud Director (VCD) Login
The new portal will be handling logins to VCD. We are aware that this will impact the majority of our customers' workflows. Unfortunately it isn't technically possible for both solutions to handle this functionality separately.

Please refer to [this page](./vcd-login.md) for more details.

### Virtual Cloud Director (VCD) User and Permission Management
The way VCD accounts are handled have been changed. Please refer to [this page](./vcd-permissions.md) for more details.

### Account Management (user details and password)
