## Veeam Backup for O365 Overview

This guide outlines the steps required to implement your Office 365 Backup with AUCloud. You will be allocated a Customer Success Manager (CSM) who will assist you with the onboarding process, provide advice and act as a conduit to deeper technical support when required.

There are several steps which need to be carried out to configure your O365 Backup account in AUCloud. These steps are outlined below and covered in more detail in separate articles.  
 

## Provide AUCloud with your backup requirements

Your Sales Executive or CSM will gather your requirements including:

-   Microsoft Office Components to be backed up
-   Tenancy Size
-   Backup information including your Public IP address for gateway whitelisting
-   Backup exclusions
-   Backup schedule
-   Backup repository retention policy, and
-   The authentication method.  
     

## Creation of your account in the AUCloud Automation, Orchestration and Management Portal

Your CSM will arrange for an account to be created for you in the AUCloud Automation, Orchestration and Management Portal.

Once your account has been created, your security contact will be required to sign the Community Rules Information Security Policy (CRISP) electronically in the Portal. The CRISP dictates the behaviours and responsibilities for both AUCloud and all customers that we must jointly adhere to.  
  
  
## Configuration of Microsoft O365 Service account

You will need to configure a Microsoft Veeam Backup Service account. To prevent Microsoft throttling of the backups, we recommend creating 8 users under this account.  
 

## Provide details to AUCloud

The backup service account username and app password need to be provided to AUCloud to complete the setup of your account. These details can be entered via Webex, Zoom, Teams chat or by coming to our office and entering them manually.  
 

## Restore records through the Self-Service portal

Records can be restored through the Self-Service Portal at:

-   Official Self-Service Portal:        [https://vbo-csz.australiacloud.com.au/](https://vbo-csz.australiacloud.com.au/)
-   Protected Self-Service Portal:    [https://evbo-csz.australiacloud.com.au/](https://evbo-csz.australiacloud.com.au/)
