title: How to upload media
---

### Overview

You may find you need to upload ISO (DVD/CD) or FLP (floppy disk) media to vCloud that have already been provided by AUCloud. These media can then:

-   Be consumed by users within your organisation.
-   Facilitate the creation of VMs from scratch, which can then be saved to your catalog for future deployment.

### Uploading media

If you need to upload media from a file on your local machine, you can use the Tenant UI. To upload media from a URL, you'll need to use the Legacy UI.

### Uploading media from a local file

1. In vCloud Director, select **Libraries** from the top menu bar.

1. In the left navigation panel, click **Media & Other**.
