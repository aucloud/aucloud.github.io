As a technologist, when evaluating technology products, whether open source or proprietary, having a robust understanding of the breadth and depth of documentation (and ease of access) is crucial.</p> <p>AUCloud has recently relaunched it's documentation site as a static website, built from a GitHub repository. A number of the hyperscalers use a similar method for their documentation as:</p> <ul> <li>The open source documentation core allows users to propose changes to the documentation.</li> <li>Documentation hosted on GitHub becomes searchable within GitHub, embedding it within the workspace of developers.</li> </ul> <p>AUCloud has taken this approach, and extended it to be based on a static-website generator: <code>mkdocs</code>. Using static website generation provides us some clear advantages:</p> <ul> <li>The static website provides a lower-risk vehicle for hosting the documentation from a security point of view;</li> <li>Managing documentation 'as code' allows documentation to be easily integrated in the 'definition of done' in our agile development life cycle;</li> <li>This includes peer review processes implicit in code development platforms.</li> <li>The CI/CD process allows pre-flight checks to be integrated such as spell checking and link validation;</li> <li>We can build with and contribute back to the extended <code>mkdocs</code> ecosystem (such as <code>Material for mkdocs</code>)</li> </ul> <p>The result for AUCloud is an documentation site that is fast, easy to maintain, easily searchable and easily updatable.</p>","tags":["mkdocs","documentation","CICD","GitHub"]},{"location":"Blog/documentation_as_opensource/#continuous-documentation-integration-and-continuous-documentation-delivery-cdicdd","title":"Continuous Documentation Integration and Continuous Documentation Delivery (CDI/CDD)","text":"<p>Our DevOps workflows have to provide functionality for two scenarios:</p> <ol> <li>The external repository where:</li> <li>There is only one version of the website (the current <code>main</code> branch).</li> <li>External contributions, which are assumed to be \"small\" must be validated.</li> <li>A private repository where:</li> <li>AUCloud employees may need to stage larger contributions (e.g. for an upcoming product launch).<ol> <li>Implicitly this implies providing previews of the staged version of the website.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <p>We serve these from a common repository that is synchronized across our internal GitHub Enterprise Server, and the <code>github.com</code> repository.

Typically mike is used to support multiple versions of software products. In this case, mike is used to generate a version of the website, per branch pushed to our private repository.

Currently the largest single time consumer in the build process is validation of external and internal links.

You can expand the scale-out backup repository at any moment. For example, if backup data grows and the backup repository reaches the storage limit, you can add a new storage system to the scale-out backup repository. The free space on this storage system will be added to the capacity of the scale-out backup repository.

The first replication creates a copy at a remote location, after which the replicated VM is updated according to a predefined schedule to match the source VM.</p> <p>There are two types of replication:</p> <ul> <li>Incoming replications</li> <li>Outgoing replications</li> </ul> <p>Incoming Replications</p> <p>Configure incoming replications to secure a remote workload by replicating it to the local VMware Cloud Director location. Such replications run on a remote site, protected at the local vCD location.</p> <p>Outgoing Replications</p> <p>Configure outgoing replications to secure a local workload by replicating it to a remote site (on-prem or\u00a0VMware Cloud Director). Outgoing replications run on a local site, protected at the remote location.</p> <p>How to Configure Incoming Replication</p> <p>After deployment, you can configure local replications. This process is required if you want to replicate\u00a0from\u00a0the cloud\u00a0to\u00a0the local vCenter or use the\u00a0reverse\u00a0replication after a failover.</p> <p>a.

Here, you can configure protection for on-premises VMs.</p> <p>c. Click on\u00a0New Protection. The\u00a0New Incoming Replication\u00a0window will appear.</p> <p></p> <p>d.\u00a0In it, you first need to define the\u00a0Source Site, which is the on-premises site owning the vApps and VMs you want to replicate. Click\u00a0Next.</p> <p></p> <p>e.\u00a0Select the VMs you want to protect by checking the corresponding box(es). To continue, click\u00a0Next.</p> <p>f. Move on to selecting the\u00a0Target VDC.</p> <p>g. On the page\u00a0Seed VM,\u00a0choose whether you want to seed. This option is only available if the VMs and VApps marked to be replicated already have an older copy on the target site. The older version is then used as a seed to speed up data transfer.</p> <p>h. Configure the\u00a0Protection Settings\u00a0by establishing your:</p> <ol> <li>RPO\u00a0\u2013 Target\u00a0Recovery Point Objective. The RPO will determine the maximum data loss that you can tolerate.</li> <li>Storage policy\u00a0\u2013 As per storage selected</li> <li>Retention policy\u00a0\u2013 How many instances you want to preserve over a time period, evenly</li> <li>Enable Quiesce\u00a0\u2013 Ensure application-level consistency prior to creating an instance</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>i.\u00a0Once you define protection settings, continue to\u00a0Scheduling.

During this operation, VMware Cloud Director Availability copies the whole data from the source vApp or VM to a datastore in the target site. Use replication seeds to reduce the network traffic and the time that is required for the initial full synchronization of a replication.</p> <p>Due to the size of the vApp or VM or to the network bandwidth, an initial full synchronisation might take a long time. To reduce the initial synchronisation time, you copy the source vApp or VM to the target site by using removable media, failover of a previous replication, or other means of data transfer. Then, in the target site, configure a replication that uses the vApp or VM copy as a replication seed.</p> <p>When a replication uses a seed vApp or VM, VMware Cloud Director Availability does not copy the whole source vApp or VM data to the target site. Instead, VMware Cloud Director Availability copies only the different data blocks between the source vApp or VM and the seed and reuses the seed data in the target site as a basis for replication.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>VMware Cloud Director Availability stores the replication data in the target site without creating copies of the seed vApp or VM.

The size and number of disks, and their assignment to disk controllers and bus nodes must match the replication source and the seed VM.</p> <p>For example, if a replication source VM has two 4 GB disks, one of them assigned to SCSI controller 0 at bus number 0, the second one to SCSI controller 1 at bus number 2. Your seed VM must have the same hardware configuration - two 4 GB disks, at SCSI 0:0 and at SCSI 1:2.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use a vApp as a Replication Seed     To use a vApp as a seed, in the target site, select a vApp that has an identical VM set with the seed vApp. The VMs in the seed vApp must have a matching name to the VMs in the source site vApp. Each VM in the seed vApp, must meet the prerequisites to be a seed VM of the VM with the same name in the source site.</p> <p>After you start a replication, in the\u00a0VMware Cloud Director\u00a0inventory, the seed vApp is empty and you can manually copy the vApp settings and metadata that are not replicated from the source site. The seed vApp remains available as an empty copy and you can remove it at your discretion.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create a Replication Seed     Use one of the following methods to create a seed vApp or VM in the target site.</p> <ul> <li>Offline data transfer: Export the VM as an\u00a0OVF\u00a0package and a Cloud service administrator imports the package to your cloud organization.</li> <li>Clone a VM: Create a seed vApp or VM by cloning the vApp or VM from the target site.VMware Cloud Director Availability\u00a0calculates the checksum and exchanges the different blocks from the replication source to the seed vApp or VM.</li> <li>Failover data from a previous replication: Set up a replication, fail over to the target site and continue using the on-premises workload. At a later point, you protect it in the target site by using the VM that you failed over earlier as a seed.</li> <li>Copy over the network: Copy a source VM to the cloud organization and transfer the source data to the target site by using other means than\u00a0VMware Cloud Director Availability.  </li> </ul> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Platform_Services/Disaster_Recovery_and_Migration/vcd_availability_replication_policies/#export-a-virtual-machine-or-a-vapp-to-a-removable-media","title":"Export a Virtual Machine or a vApp to a Removable Media","text":"<p>To use a replication seed for configuring a replication, you must export a virtual machine to removable media and provide it to AUCloud.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Power off the virtual machine on the protected side by using the vSphere Client</p> </li> <li> <p>Export a virtual machine form vCenter Server to a removable media.</p> <pre><code>ovftool 'vi://root@VC_IP/Datacenter_Name/vm/VM_FQDN' VM_FQDN.ova\n</code></pre> <p>After the process finishes, you can power on the virtual machine</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) Export a vApp from VMware Cloud Director to a removable media.</p> <pre><code>ovftool 'vcloud://ORG_ADMIN@VCLOUD_DIRECTOR_IP:443?org=ORG_NAME&amp;vdc=VDC_NAME&amp;vapp=VAPP_NAME' VAPP_NAME.ova\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Provide the removable media containing the exported files to AUCloud.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Platform_Services/Disaster_Recovery_and_Migration/vcd_availability_replication_policies/#configure-a-replication-by-using-a-replication-seed","title":"Configure a Replication by Using a Replication Seed","text":"<p>When creating a new incoming or outgoing replication, you can use a vApp or VM as a seed to avoid transferring large amounts of data over the network during the initial full synchronisation.</p> <p>Before starting a replication, in the target site you must power off the seed VMs, because they are unregistered from the target VMware Cloud Director and vCenter Server inventories.
